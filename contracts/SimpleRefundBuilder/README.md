# SimpleRefundBuilder

`The SimpleRefundBuilder` is a **Solidity** smart contract for efficiently generating [Refund provider](https://github.com/The-Poolz/LockDealNFT/tree/master/contracts/AdvancedProviders/RefundProvider) **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** on a large scale. By harnessing the capabilities of this contract, users can initiate the creation of multiple `RefundProvider NFTs` in a single transaction, simplifying the management of refundable deals.

### Building Mass Refund Pools

```solidity
function buildMassPools(
        address[] calldata addressParams,
        Builder calldata userData,
        uint256[][] calldata params,
        bytes calldata tokenSignature,
        bytes calldata mainCoinSignature
    ) public
```

**The buildMassPools** function is a core feature of the `SimpleRefundBuilder` contract, offering a convenient and efficient mechanism for the mass creation of `Refund provider` **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**. This function enables users to initiate the creation of multiple refund pools in a single transaction.

#### Parameters:

```solidity
// An array containing three addresses:
// addressParams[0]: simpleProvider: The address of the simple provider contract.
// addressParams[1]: token: The address of the ERC-20 token used in user pools.
// addressParams[2]: mainCoin: The address of the main coin employed in refund offers.
address[] calldata addressParams;
```

```solidity
// A data structure containing user-related information for the mass creation of refund pools.
// Builder.userPools: An array of UserPool structures, where each structure contains:
// Builder.userPools.user: The address of the user participating in the refund pool.
// Builder.userPools.amount: The amount of tokens allocated to the user's pool.
// totalAmount: The total amount of tokens involved in the mass pool creation.
Builder calldata userData;
```

```solidity
// A matrix array containing parameters for the mass pool creation process:
// params[0]: Collateral parameters, including the starting amount and finish time.
// params[1]: Array of parameters for the simple provider. This array may be empty if the provider is a DealProvider.
uint256[][] calldata params;
```

```solidity
// The cryptographic signature associated with token-related operations, providing a secure means of token transfer.
bytes calldata tokenSignature;
```

```solidity
// The cryptographic signature associated with main coin-related operations in collateralized deals,
// ensuring the integrity of main coin transfers.
bytes calldata mainCoinSignature;
```

### Collateral Provider

After creating mass refund pools, `msg.sender` assumes the role of the **Project owner**. The **Project owner** possesses an NFT from the `Collateral Provider`, allowing interaction for governance purposes
